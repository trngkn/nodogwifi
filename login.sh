# Get the urlencoded querystring
query_enc="$1"

# The query string is sent to us from NDS in a urlencoded form,
# so we must decode it here so we can parse it:
query=$(printf "${query_enc//%/\\x}")

# In this example script we want to ask the client user for
# their username and email address.
#
# We could ask for anything we like and add our own variables to the html forms
# we generate.
#
# If we want to show a sequence of forms or information pages we can do this easily.
#
# To return to this script and show additional pages, the form action must be set to:
#	<form action=\"/nodogsplash_preauth/\" method=\"get\">
# Note: quotes ( " ) must be escaped with the "\" character.
#
# Any variables we need to preserve and pass back to ourselves or NDS must be added 
# to the form as hidden:
#	<input type=\"hidden\" name=......
# Such variables will appear in the query string when NDS re-calls this script.
# We can then parse for them again.
#
# When the logic of this script decides we should allow the client to access the Internet
# we inform NDS with a final page displaying a continue button with the form action set to:
#	"<form action=\"/nodogsplash_auth/\" method=\"get\">"
#
# We must also send NDS the client token as a hidden variable, but first we must obtain
# the token from ndsctl using a suitable command such as:
#	tok="$(ndsctl json $clientip | grep token | cut -c 10- | cut -c -8)"
#
# In a similar manner we can obtain any client or NDS information that ndsctl provides. 

# The query string NDS sends to us will always be of the following form (with a "comma space" separator):
# ?clientip=[clientipaddress], gatewayname=[gatewayname], redir=[originalurl], var4=[data], var5=[data], var6......
#
# The first three variables will be clientip, gatewayname and redir
#
# We have chosen to name redir as $requested here as it is actually the originally requested url.
#
# There is one exception to this. If the client presses "back" on their browser NDS detects this
# and tells us by returning status=authenticated instead of redir=[originalurl]
# If we detect this we show a page telling the client they are already logged in.
#
# Additional variables returned by NDS will be those we define here and send to NDS via an
# html form method=get
# See the examples here for $username and $emailaddress
#
# There is no limit to the number of variables we can define dynamically
# as long as the query string does not exceed 2048 bytes.
#
# The query string will be truncated if it does exceed this length.


# Parse for the system variables always sent by NDS:
clientip="$(echo $query | awk -F ', ' '{print $1;}' | awk -F 'clientip=' '{print $2;}')"
gatewayname="$(echo $query | awk -F ', ' '{print $2;}' | awk -F 'gatewayname=' '{print $2;}')"

# The third system variable is either the originally requested url:
requested="$(echo $query | awk -F ', ' '{print $3;}' | awk -F 'redir=' '{print $2;}')"

# or it is a status message:
status="$(echo $query | awk -F ', ' '{print $3;}' | awk -F 'status=' '{print $2;}')"

# Parse for additional variables we define in this script, in this case username and emailaddr
username="$(echo $query | awk -F ', ' '{print $4;}' | awk -F 'username=' '{print $2;}')"
emailaddr="$(echo $query | awk -F ', ' '{print $5;}' | awk -F 'emailaddr=' '{print $2;}')"


# Define some common html as the first part of the page to be served by NDS
#
# Note this example uses the default splash.css provided by NDS and uses splash.jpg
# as the browser shortcut icon.
#
# You can decide how your PreAuth splash page will look
# by incorporating your own css and images.
#
# Note however that the output of this script will be displayed on the client device screen via the CPD process on that device.
# It should be noted when designing a custom splash page that for security reasons many client device CPD implementations:
#
#	Immediately close the browser when the client has authenticated.
#	Prohibit the use of href links.
#	Prohibit downloading of external files (including .css and .js, even if they are allowed in NDS firewall settings).
#	Prohibit the execution of javascript.
